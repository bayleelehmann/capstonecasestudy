            <h2>The Hook</h2>
                <h3>Create a more dynamic interaction between the users and the garden through a digital lens.</h3>
                <p>This semester, I originally planned to expand this project significantly. Instead, I focused on refining the UI, revisiting it multiple times to improve the task flow based on user feedback. This page will guide you through how I gathered user insights and used them to adjust and enhance the flows.</p>
            <h2>Brief Description</h2>
                <p>Spanning approximately 130 acres, the Botanical Gardens showcase living collections across 16 breathtaking themed gardens, home to over 83,000 plants—including rare and endangered species. This vibrant landscape also serves as a hub for botanical conservation and research. With such a vast and culturally rich space, visitors are invited to explore the beauty and diversity of global horticultural traditions. This project aims to enhance that experience by offering a digital platform that deepens visitors’ understanding of both horticulture and art, enriching every step of their journey through the gardens.
                    The Huntington recently unveiled refreshed branding and an updated website, offering a more modern digital experience for booking tickets, exploring the grounds online, and shopping for merchandise. However, these enhancements are currently limited to the website. This presents an ideal opportunity to introduce a dedicated wayfinding app—one that guides visitors through the gardens, provides immersive digital learning about the grounds, and extends access to shopping features, all from the palm of their hands.

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                    <h3>“Visitors of the museum need an interactive digital tool to allow more freedom during their experience and provide a an interactive educational tool.”</h3>

            <h2>Deliverables</h2>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>For my capstone project, my goal is to continue building upon the foundation I laid during my final project in Experimental Interaction, and bring it closer to a fully realized product. This project represents the culmination of everything I’ve learned throughout the program, and I want it to serve as a comprehensive showcase of my growth and capabilities. Specifically, I aim to highlight my strengths in user research, project management, and UX/UI design.

                    To begin, I’ll focus on evaluating what I’ve already built. So far, I’ve developed one core task flow, but gathering user feedback at this stage is essential. By testing the current prototype with real users, I can identify areas for improvement and ensure that the final product is both functional and meaningful. Iteration will be a key part of my process, and I plan to seek feedback early and often to guide thoughtful refinements.
                    Accessibility, responsiveness, and usability are my top priorities—this app needs to work for everyone. At the same time, I want to push myself creatively by refining the interactive elements, motion design, and overall visual polish of the user interface. I see this as an opportunity to stretch beyond utility and create a rich, engaging experience that also meets high standards for design and accessibility.

In the final weeks of the semester, I plan to present my work through an interactive prototype and a well-documented case study. This will include research insights, design rationale, user testing outcomes, and iterations. To support this, I’ll need to refresh and sharpen my coding skills so I can bring a more functional version of the app to life.

Ultimately, this capstone is not just about completing a project—it’s about proving to myself and others that I can lead a thoughtful, user-centered design process from research to execution, with clarity, creativity, and purpose.</p>
